                <p>The present
                    Kushinagar is identified with Kusavati (in the pre-Buddha period) and Kushinara (in the
                    post-Buddha period). Kushinara was the capital of Mallas which was one of the sixteen mahajanpads of the 6th
                    Century BCE. Since then, it remained an integral part of the erstwhile empires of Maurya, Shunga, Kushana, Gupta,
                    Harsha, and Pala dynasties.

                    In the medieval period, Kushinagar had passed under the suzerainty of Kultury Kings. Kushinara
                    continued to be a living city till the 12th century CE and was thereafter lost into oblivion. Padrauna is believed to
                    be ruled over by a Rajput adventurer, Madan Singh, in the 15th century CE.

                    Conjectural reconstruction of the main gate of Kusinagara circa 500 BCE adapted from this relief at
                    Sanchi.

                    However, modern Kushinagar came into prominence in the 19th century with archeological excavations
                    carried out by Alexander Cunningham, the first Archeological Surveyor of India and later followed by C.L.
                    Carlleyle who exposed the main stupa and also discovered a 6.10 meters long statue of reclining Buddha in 1876.
                    Excavation continued in the early twentieth century under J. Ph. Vogel. He conducted archaeological campaigns
                    in 1904-5, 1905-6 and 1906-7, uncovering a wealth of Buddhist materials.

                    Chandra Swami, a Burmese monk, came to India in 1903 and made Mahaparinirvana Temple into a living
                    shrine.

                    After independence, Kushinagar remained part of the district of Deoria. On 13 May 1994, it came into
                    being
                    as a
                    new district of Uttar Pradesh.</p>

                    <p>Kushinagar and Kasia Bazar is a town and a historical place located in the north-eastern marginal
                    area of
                    ​​Uttar
                    Pradesh. The name “Kasia Bazar” has been changed to Kushinagar and after that “Kasia Bazar” has
                    officially
                    become a municipality with the name “Kushinagar”. This is a Buddhist pilgrimage where Gautam Buddha
                    had
                    Mahaparinirvana. Kushinagar is located on National Highway 28, about 50 km east of Gorakhpur. There
                    are
                    many
                    beautiful Buddhist temples here. For this reason, it is also an international tourist destination
                    where
                    Buddhists pilgrims from all over the world come for excursions. After the Kushinagar town and
                    eastwards,
                    Bihar
                    state starts about 20 km.

                    There are also Buddha Postgraduate Colleges, Buddha Intermediate College and many small schools. The
                    area
                    around
                    Kushinagar is mainly agricultural. Bhojpuri is a popular spoken language. Here are main crops of
                    wheat,
                    paddy,
                    sugarcane etc.

                    On the occasion of Buddha Purnima, there is a month’s fair in Kushinagar. Although this shrine is
                    related to
                    Mahatma Buddha, the surrounding area is Hindu dominated. In this fair, the people around the place
                    participate
                    with complete reverence and perform puja and worship in various temples. Nobody is sure that Buddha
                    is
                    their
                    ‘God’.

                    where
